# **Hosting WordPress using AWS CloudFormation**

### Version 1.0.0

---

This reference architecture provides a set of YAML templates for deploying WordPress on AWS using [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html), [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html), [Auto Scaling](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/WhatIsAutoScaling.html), [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html), [Amazon Route 53](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html) with [AWS CloudFormation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html).
## Overview

![architecture-overview](images/Diagram.jpeg)

The repository consists of a set of nested templates which are run in order from the master template. Run the master template to create the entire stack, entering the appropriate parameters. Nested templates can be run individually in order, entering the appropriate input parameters for each stack.
## Parameters


## Steps to Run
To launch the entire stack and deploy a WordPress site on AWS, click on one of the ***Launch Stack*** links below or download the Master template and launch it locally.

You can launch this CloudFormation stack, using your account, in the following AWS Regions:

#### Optional: Encrypting Amazon Aurora DB data at Rest

This reference architecture now allows you to encrypt your databases using keys you manage through AWS Key Management Service (KMS). On a database instance running with Amazon Aurora encryption, data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted, as are the automated backups, snapshots, and replicas in the same cluster. Encryption and decryption are handled seamlessly so you donâ€™t have to modify your application to access your data. When you launch this AWS Cloudformation stack, you can choose to enable database encryption via a parameter in the master template. You may use the default RDS key automatically created in your account by leaving the *"Existing AWS KMS CMK for RDS"* parameter empty or use a key you created using KMS to encrypt your data.

#### Stack Creation

There are two output URLs for the master template. The WPSiteURL will take you to your new WordPress site. It will be the site domain name if you provided one, the CloudFront URL if you chose to create a CloudFront distribution, or the domain name of the public application load balancer.  The second output URL will take you to the OpCache Status page for each EC2 instance in the AutoScaling group. By refreshing the page you will be able to verify OpCache has been enabled on each instance.

#### OPcache

OPcache is a byte-code cache engine running on each EC2 instance that caches precompiled PHP scripts that boosts performance of PHP applications like WordPress. It is recommended to use a caching engine like OpCache when serving PHP pages for a website from Amazon EFS.  OPcache can be configured to store it's cache in memory or on EBS volumes.


#### Offloading Static Assets

WordPress has a large partner ecosystem to further enhance the usability, performance, and ease of maintenance of WordPress deployments. Plugins, like W3-Total-Cache, allow you to leverage other AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront to offload and store static content. Others may like the simplicity of storing all content on Amazon EFS and avoid installing and managing 3rd party plugins. 

#### Setup W3-Total-Cache
The W3-Total-Cache plugin is required for the reference architecutre to have the best performance. W3 allows Offloading of static assets, and impliments memcached to cache Objects, Database Queries, ect.

To setup W3-Total-Cache, activate it in plugins (Will be installed automatically on fresh CloudFormation launch). Navigate to ElasticCache -> Memcached in AWS, find the cluster created for the stack. Copy the **Configuration Endpoint** (formated: wor-el-1d6494yen6xl1.xxxxxx.cfg.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com:11211). Now under performance -> General, find the following options:

- Page Cache - enable, select Memcached
- Minify - enable, select Disk (Minified files will be offloaded)
- Database Cache - enable, select Memcached
- Object Cache - enable, select Memcached
- CDN - enable, select Amazon Cloudfront - Or Amazon Simple Storage Service
- Fragment Cache - enable, select Memcached

Press Save All & Purge Cache

You will see errors saying 127.0.0.1:11211 not accessible. 
Now Inside each menu in the sidebar navigation, scroll to Memcached server option (Advanced), and paste the ElasticCache Configuration Endpoint. Press test and ensure it passes.

Under Browser Cache, enable both **Set expires header** and **Set cache control header** (When testing this may be combersome)

Under CDN, paste in a valid and uniquely created IAM Key and Secret that has access to S3 or an S3 bucket. Paste in the Cloudfront prefix that was created with the stack. Also scroll to Advanced and select **Export changed files automatically**

Since files will be offloaded to S3, ensure to add the S3 bucket as an origin on your CloudFront Distribution. Simply navigate to the distribution, select the Origin tab, Create Origin, Click on the Origin Domain Name text field and find the S3 bucket used for CDN. **Note:** This will take some time, the Distribution will be In Progress until CDN replication is complete. 

## Master Template
The master template receives all input parameters and passes them to the appropriate nested template which are executed in order based on conditions and dependencies.

- Amazon CloudFront distribution (optional)
- Amazon Route53 DNS record set (optional)

### Input Parameters

#### General AWS
- EC2 Key Name Pair
- SSH Access CIDR block (to access bastion host)
- Email address for WordPress administration and SNS notifications
- Site Domain Name (e.g. 'example.com') - use this only if you will use your own custom domain name
- Select if you want to create a DNS record set for your custom dist domain name
- Select if you want to use a AWS CloudFront to cache images at AWS edge locations (3rd party plugins are required to leverage a CDN)
- Enter the ARN of the AWS Certificate Manager certificate you created in us-east-1 for your custom site domain name

#### Network
- Number of Avilability Zones (AZs) - from 2 to 6
- Select the individual Availability Zones where resources will be launched (the number of selected AZs must match the number of AZs selected above)
- VPC CIDR block
- VPC tenancy
- CIDR block for public subnets 1 to 6
- CIDR block for web subnets 1 to 6
- CIDR block for data subnets 1 to 6

#### File System
- Amazon EFS performance mode
- Encrypted file system (boolean)
- AWS KMS Customer Master Key ARN (if enabling encryption and using customer-managed CMK)
- Clone EFS, use the System ID of an existing EFS Filesystem. The data is copied to the Site Directory. If the Site Directory exists on the source filesystem, only the contents of the site directory are copied. So make sure if you are copying from an existing Wordpress Cloudformation template, that the site directory is the same.
- Add dummy data to the file system to achieve higher throughput & IOPS beyond the amount of data your WordPress environment will use. This value is in GiB.
- The instance type that will be used to dd dummy data into the file system
- Select if you want to create alarms that send SNS notifications when the file system's burst credit balance drops below certain thresholds.
- The instance type that will be used to dynamically adjust alarm thresholds as permitted throughput changes.
- The 'Warning' threshold has a default value of 180 minutes. This means that a CloudWatch alarm will send an email notification 180 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate.
- The 'Critical' threshold has a default value of 60 minutes. This means that a CloudWatch alarm will send an email notification 60 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate.
